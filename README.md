# manage-GNU-screen-sessions
switch between different screen session running in different terminals


----How to use this Program-----

You open many instances of screen in any of the many terminals you open
so there are multiple sessions of screen running in different terminals

You do not have to go about hunting or listing the different sessions manually
This would display a menu of the running sessions and allows you to switch to it

It takes no arguments

open a terminal and type

screenx 

Note: idk, does not work, weird behaviour.
